# OOP-Miniproject
My miniproject (Final Project Assessment) for ECS414 - Object-Oriented Programming.

## Description
For the miniproject, we had to create a Java application which used the Java collection classes, Swing and the code base produced by previous class projects. 

One of the previous assignments was to allow the user to run elections via a GUI made using Swing. I decided to develop this further by displaying a bar chart of the election results once an election has ran.
